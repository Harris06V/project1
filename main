"""
DNA and Protein Mutation Analysis Tool
======================================

This Python module provides a functionalities for identifying, analyzing, and visualizing
mutations in DNA sequences. It covers mutations at both the DNA level (insertions, deletions,
and substitutions) and the amino acid level (missense, nonsense, no change). The tool can be
applied to compare wild-type and patient DNA sequences, with the assumption that the patient
sequence differs by a single base mutation.

Key Features:
-------------
1. **Sequence Validation (verify_dna_sequence):**
   - Validates whether a given sequence is a valid DNA (A, T, C, G) sequence.

2. **Base Distribution Calculation (get_dna_distribution):**
   - Computes the distribution of nucleotide bases (A, T, C, G) in a given DNA sequence.

3. **Open Reading Frame (ORF) Extraction (get_orf):**
   - Identifies all possible open reading frames (ORFs) from an RNA sequence.
   - Extracts and returns the longest ORF found in the sequence.

4. **DNA Transcription (transcribe_dna):**
   - Transcribes a DNA sequence (template sequence) into its corresponding RNA sequence.

5. **DNA Mutation Detection (identify_dna_mutation):**
   - Detects mutations at the DNA level by comparing the wild-type and patient sequences.
   - Classifies mutations into one of three categories: insertion, deletion, or substitution.
   - Provides details on the type of mutation, its position, and the base involved.

6. **Amino Acid Mutation Detection (identify_aa_mutation):**
   - Identifies mutations at the amino acid level by comparing the wild-type and patient RNA sequences.
   - Classifies mutations into missense (amino acid change) or nonsense (premature stop codon) mutations.
   - Provides information about the affected amino acid, its position, and the type of mutation.

7. **BRCA1 Mutation Check (is_brac_mutation):**
   - Confirms whether the patient's sequence differs from the wild type by exactly one base mutation.

8. **Mutation Visualization:**
   - **DNA-Level Visualization (visualize_dna_mutation):**
     - Visually represents DNA mutations (insertion, deletion, substitution) in a clear format, focusing
       on the mutation site and nearby bases.
   - **Amino Acid-Level Visualization (visualize_aa_mutation):**
     - Visually represents amino acid mutations, showing the wild-type and patient protein sequences and
       highlighting any changes.

9. **File Reading (read_sequence_from_file):**
    - Reads and retrieves DNA sequences from files, ensuring they are correctly formatted.

10. **Mutation Report (main):**
    - Performs the mutation analysis between the wild-type and patient DNA sequences.
    - Generates a detailed report, including:
      - The type of DNA mutation (if any) and its visualization.
      - The type of amino acid mutation (if any) and its visualization.
      - A comparison of the ORFs from the wild-type and patient sequences, highlighting any differences
        in start/stop codons and mutation locations within the ORF.

Workflow:
---------
1. The wild-type and patient DNA sequences are read from external files.
2. Sequences are validated to ensure they are valid DNA sequences.
3. A preliminary test was run to make sure the patient DNA is similar to the wild type
3. DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA.
4. The longest open reading frame (ORF) is extracted from the wild-type
5. The ORF on the patient RNA sequences is found based on the ORF of the wild-type.
5. DNA-level mutations (insertion, deletion, substitution) are identified and classified.
6. Amino acid-level mutations (missense, nonsense, etc.) are detected based on the DNA mutations.
7. Both DNA and amino acid mutations are visualized, focusing on relevant regions of the sequences.
8. A mutation report is generated, comparing the wild-type and patient sequences and
   explaining the potential effects of the mutation.

Assumptions:
------------
- Only a single base mutation is present between the wild-type and patient sequences.
- Mutations are classified as either insertion, deletion, or substitution at the DNA level.
